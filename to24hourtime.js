// Converting a 12-hour time like "8:30 am" or "8:30 pm" to 24-hour time (like "0830" or "2030") sounds easy enough, right? Well, let's see if you can do it!

// You will have to define a function, which will be given an hour (always in the range of 1 to 12, inclusive), a minute (always in the range of 0 to 59, inclusive), and a period (either "am" or "pm") as input.

// Your task is to return a four-digit string that encodes that time in 24-hour time.

// Notes
// By convention, noon is 12:00 pm, and midnight is 12:00 am.
// On 12-hours clock, there is no 0 hour, and time just after midnight is denoted as, for example, 12:15 am. On 24-hour clock, this translates to 0015.

function to24hourtime(hour, minute, period) {
    // hour will always range from 1 to 12 (inclusive)
    // minute will always range from 0 to 59 (inclusive)
    // period will always be either "am" or "pm"
    const amResult = "0" + (hour *100 + minute).toString()
    const pmResult = ((hour + 12)*100 + minute).toString()
    
    if(hour === 12 && period === "am") return '0000'
    if(hour === 12 && period === "pm") return '1200'
    
    if(period == "pm"){
      return pmResult
    }
    return amResult;
  }
